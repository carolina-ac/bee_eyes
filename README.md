# Biplot Analysis with PCA in R

## Overview
This repository contains an R script for performing PCA and generating a biplot that includes both data points and variable loadings. This is particularly useful for visualizing the contribution of each variable to the principal components in a dataset.

## Features
- **PCA Computation**: Calculates principal components using the provided dataset.
- **Biplot Visualization**: Visualizes both the scores and loadings in a single plot, enhancing interpretability of PCA results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- R environment (RStudio recommended)
