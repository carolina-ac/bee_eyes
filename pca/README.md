# **PCA Biplot Analysis Tools**

## **Overview**
This repository provides tools for performing PCA and generating biplots in both R and Python, specifically tailored to analyze the morphology of eyes in diurnal and crepuscular bees. These scripts are designed to help visualize the influence of variables on the principal components of a dataset, suitable for exploratory data analysis in fields such as genetics, economics, and more.

## **Features**
- **PCA Calculation**: Both scripts calculate principal components using standardized data.
- **Biplot Visualization**: Visualizes data points along with variable loadings to interpret the PCA results.
